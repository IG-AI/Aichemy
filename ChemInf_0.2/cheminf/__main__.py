22/02-2020, AJL: 
    Added multiclass protocol.
24/03-2020, AJL: 
    Added (de)compressed data handling.
08/04-2020, LS:  
    Revision of decompression and modularity implementation.
06/07-2020, LS: 
    Implementation of k-fold cross validation.
28/09-2020 - 30/10-2020, DA: 
    Completely revamped the code with a object originated approached, extended the available classifiers with a 
    dynamic neural network, added data utils, completely changed to how the user interact with the program to make it
    more user-friendly and added a setup script, a conda env file and pip env requirements file for easier installation 
    of the program with more options for the user.
